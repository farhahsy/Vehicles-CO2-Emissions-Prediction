# Driving Towards Sustainability: Predictive Analytics for Vehicles‚Äô Carbon Dioxide Emissions

## üìå Executive Summary

Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) is a naturally occurring gas, but its increased emissions‚Äîparticularly from vehicles‚Äîpose a significant threat to global climate change. 
This project investigates the relationships between various vehicle characteristics (such as class, engine size, fuel type, and driving conditions) and their impact on CO‚ÇÇ emissions. 
By leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning, this project aims to uncover key emission factors and build a model that accurately predicts vehicle CO‚ÇÇ emissions.

This study adopts the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, a structured and systematic approach to data analytics, ensuring each phase of the project is executed effectively.

## üìà Expected Outcomes

- An accurate ML model to predict CO‚ÇÇ emissions based on key vehicle attributes.
- A Power BI dashboard that presents actionable insights to automotive manufacturers.
- A structured analytics workflow following the CRISP-DM methodology.

These outcomes will aid manufacturers in designing more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles, meeting evolving regulations and contributing to sustainable transportation efforts.
